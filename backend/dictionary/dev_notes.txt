NEXT FLASH CARDS DEV NOTES:
---------------------------
---------------------------



Docker container setup (for dictionary/text-parser/youtube functionality) for /d-api/v1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
for our backend to be able to run, we need to have mongodb instance running on port 27017 locally
best is to use just mongdb image/container 

docker run -it -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo
docker start mongodb

we need to seed the database with basic data 

dictionary data:
//node seed_jitendex_data.js    # uses dir jitendex_json_data, NOT NEEDED YET (hard to parse)
node seed_jmdict_data.js      # uses dir jmdict_json_data_simplified, NOW WE USE ONLY JMDICT

kanjidic data (no need to seed to db, relatively small file):
kanjidic/kanjidic2.json

radical data (no need to seed to db, small file):
radicals/kradfile_decoded_euc_jp.json
radicals/radicals_wikipedia.json


server-text-parser.js   

needs configs 
config.json   file for DEEPL API key
.env          file for GPT API keys 

is express daemon that manages all text-parser, mecab, youtube, kanji, radicals, dictionary 
that is not user specific (user specific stuff managed by python dynamic backend)
so for this express functionality we just need static seeded database


// ------------ DOCKER BUILD /d-api/v1 -------------- //

handles text parser/youtube/mecab/chat gpt/mecab logic, database has only static data (automatic seeding)

docker build . -t coil/zen-lingo:dictionary-db
docker push coil/zen-lingo:dictionary-db

docker run -it -p 5200:5200 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway coil/zen-lingo:dictionary-db # interactive
docker run -d -p 5200:5200  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway coil/zen-lingo:dictionary-db # daemonised













// -------------------------- APIs --------------------------------- //

go to http://localhost:3000/flashcards
it is simplified flashcard endpoint that is using only python backend
so is self sustaining

---

python API endpoints:

@app.route("/api/clone-collection", methods=["POST"])
def clone_collection():

@app.route("/api/combine-data", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def combine_data():

@app.route("/api/flashcard/<userId>", methods=['GET'])
def get_flashcard_states(userId):

@app.route("/api/flashcard", methods=['POST'])
def store_flashcard_state():
---

for streamlined flashcards we have separate page
(using user specific python backend that combines flashcard data - dynamic db with static source db)



// curl -X GET "http://localhost:5100/api/combine-data?userId=testUser&collectionName=kanji&p_tag=JLPT_N3&s_tag=part_1"
const apiUrl = `http://localhost:5100/api/combine-data?userId=${userId}&collectionName=${collectionName}&p_tag=${p_tag}&s_tag=${s_tag}`;


Interconnection with static DB API:
-----------------------------------
static DB will live in different container / different API will handle access to static DB
hence we need to have the static backend up and running for our tests 
the static express container runs locally on port 7000/8000

our dynamic flask container runs classically on port 5100

we need now to get static kanji data from the port 7000



Tests:
------
health
curl -X GET http://localhost:5100/health

cloning kanji
curl -X POST http://localhost:5100/f-api/v1/clone-static-collection-kanji -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId": "testUser", "collection": "kanji", "p_tag": "JLPT_N3"}'

cloning words
# curl -X POST http://localhost:5100/f-api/v1/clone-static-collection-words -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId": "testUser", "collection": "words", "p_tag": "suru_essential_600_verbs"}'  # w only p_tag
# curl -X POST http://localhost:5100/f-api/v1/clone-static-collection-words -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId": "testUser", "collection": "words", "p_tag": "essential_600_verbs"}'  # w only p_tag

GET just static kanji data:
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/e-api/v1/kanji?p_tag=JLPT_N3&s_tag=part_1"

flashcard info combining - kanji
# curl -X POST http://localhost:5100/f-api/v1/combine-flashcard-data-kanji -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId": "testUser", "collectionName": "kanji", "p_tag": "JLPT_N3", "s_tag": "part_1"}'
# curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://localhost:5100/f-api/v1/combine-flashcard-data-kanji?userId=testUser&collectionName=kanji&p_tag=JLPT_N3&s_tag=part_1"

flashcard info combining - words



Containerization
----------------


so based on that we will find the volume to mount 
and we should be good then

docker build . -t coil/zen-lingo:flask-dynamic-db


mkdir -p /home/coil/user_db  # docker should create this by itself if needed

docker run -it -p 5100:5100 -v /home/coil/user_db:/var/lib/mongodb --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway coil/zen-lingo:flask-dynamic-db # interactive
docker run -d -p 5100:5100 -v /home/coil/user_db:/var/lib/mongodb --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway coil/zen-lingo:flask-dynamic-db


queries to the APIs  using mounted persistent volume
curl -X POST http://localhost:5100/api/clone-static-collection -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userId": "testUser", "collection": "kanji", "p_tag": "JLPT_N3"}'


calling host VM ports and apis:
this is amazing, container can call other containers/ host VM nginx and so on, amazing!
root@5461a2874a0a:/app# curl -X GET http://host.docker.internal:7000/e-api/v1/kanji
{"error":"p_tag is required"}
root@5461a2874a0a:/app# 




TODO - add correct info
DYNAMIC BACKEND FLASK+DB (handles user specific data)
docker build . -t coil/zen-lingo:flask-dynamic-db
docker push coil/zen-lingo:flask-dynamic-db
(port 5100 exposed internally)
docker run -it -p 5100:5100 coil/zen-lingo:flask-dynamic-db

----------------------- Jitendex data DB seeding ---------------------------

we seed jitendex json data to DB with 
seed_jitendex_data.js 
it expects data to be in 
jitendex_json_data dir 
new version of the seeding script is now ignoring index.jsonso we are fine 
full data is in downloads folder on windows
and also in the next-flashcards backend
memory issues with seeding were fixed










----------------------- Jitendex audio ---------------------------

how to generate vocabulary audio for jitendex dictionary
start jitendex api server

rm test.json
curl "http://localhost:5200/elements" >> test.json
(curl was failing with regular redirect)

it will have data like
[
  { "0": "自然観", "1": "しぜんかん", "_id": "661bd812dea6ac8a6b4d8ef7" },
  { "0": "自腹", "1": "じばら", "_id": "661bd812dea6ac8a6b4d8ef8" },
]

we can then use this payload to generate audio with gtts

then run shell script that generates audio for all dictionary vocab
 ./generate_jitendex_audio.sh 

audio generation can take days
so we need to split the files somehow, lets split the big json to 
like 10 smaller jsons



----------------- Kanjidic -----------------------
we are using kanji dictionary from
https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project

we took this file:
the KANJIDIC2 file, which is in XML format and Unicode/UTF-8 coding, and contains information about all 13,108 kanji. (download)
http://www.edrdg.org/kanjidic/kanjidic2.xml.gz

then we extract it to xml file

then we use our own python script to convert it to json file so it is easier to process
json will have 50 MB


---------------- Radicals radkfile ------------------------

but read more on the page, so far it looks like creative commons attribution, which is fine, but only for
RADKFILE/KRADFILE - files relating to the decomposition of the 6,355 kanji in JIS X 0208 into their visible components.
radkfile2/kradkfile2 is copyright by Jim Breen, so we would need to ask him personally :) lol


how to solve encoding issues witht he files
Resolving the Encoding Issue
To handle this, you can try opening the file with different encodings typically used for Japanese text. Here's how you can attempt to open the file with Shift-JIS (cp932) or EUC-JP (euc_jp):

python
Copy code
# Try opening with Shift-JIS
try:
    with open('radkfile', 'r', encoding='cp932') as file:
        for line in file:
            print(line.strip())
except UnicodeDecodeError as e:
    print("Failed to decode with Shift-JIS:", e)

# If Shift-JIS fails, try EUC-JP
try:
    with open('radkfile', 'r', encoding='euc_jp') as file:
        for line in file:
            print(line.strip())
except UnicodeDecodeError as e:
    print("Failed to decode with EUC-JP:", e)

the above approach worked

radkfile file look like this:
$ 亀 11
穐竃亀縄蝿龝鬮龜
$ 滴 11 3557
嫡摘敵滴適鏑謫
$ 黄 11
横黄壙廣搆擴曠礦簧鑛黌
$ 黒 11

pretty useless, since it does not say what each radical means

kradfile file is more useful, since shows given radicals

薤 : 歹 艾 韭
薈 : 日 買 个 艾 一
薑 : 一 田 二 艾
薊 : 刈 魚 田 杰 艾
薨 : 買 夕 冖 匕 艾
蕭 : ｜ ノ ヨ 米 艾 聿

kradfile is pretty useful, but we might get better results with kanji alive project



-------------------------- Kanji Alive ---------------------------
https://github.com/kanjialive/kanji-data-media
https://kanjialive.com/credits/

vast majority of kanji alive content is creative commons attribution 
we do not need memonics and some dictionary codes anyways, those are propriatery
we can generate mnemonics with chat gpt
when we know meanings of radicals and what radical is present in the kanjiwe can even write a script for that

// --------------------------- MECAB text parser -------------------------------- //


we need to install also mecab via apt on ubuntu and then mecab npm library, so it has 2 phases


I just installed all mecab stuff from apt, lol
coil@coil-VM:next-flash-cards$ sudo apt-get install mecab
mecab                   mecab-jumandic          mecab-naist-jdic-eucjp
mecab-ipadic            mecab-jumandic-utf8     mecab-utils
mecab-ipadic-utf8       mecab-naist-jdic        
coil@coil-VM:next-flash-cards$ sudo apt-get install mecab-*
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
Note, selecting 'mecab-jumandic' for glob 'mecab-*'

huh, looks like we downloaded some chinese dict, lol

just installing mecab and mecab-utils looks fine 


found this in some howto:
sudo apt-get install mecab libmecab-dev mecab-jumandic mecab-jumandic-utf8     # this looks to be the best approach

mecab-ipadic mecab-ipadic-utf8       - looks like this is causing the issues with chinese - i have removed this and issue fixed
mecab-jumandic mecab-jumandic-utf8  - fine

mecab-naist-jdic mecab-naist-jdic-eucjp  - also looks like is causing issues, removed
         


The error message indicates that the mecab command is not found on your system. MeCab is a morphological analyzer for the Japanese language, and it needs to be installed for your application to work correctly.

To install MeCab on your Ubuntu system, follow these steps:

Update your package list:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
Install MeCab and its dependencies:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install mecab libmecab-dev mecab-ipadic-utf8
Verify the installation:
Check if MeCab is installed correctly by running:

bash
Copy code
mecab --version
Install Node.js MeCab binding (if not already installed):
If you haven't already installed the MeCab binding for Node.js, you can do so with npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install mecab-async
After installing MeCab, your application should be able to find and use the mecab command. If the issue persists, make sure that the path to MeCab is correctly set in your environment variables.




// ----- mecab continuing --------

mecab is Japanese text tokenizer

what we need:
we provide japanese text, we need to get back text split by tokens

actually we need the text to come back as an array with relevant furigana as well

actually, we need to get an array of dictionary form as well
so we can search our dictionaries

so wakachi method is useful, but we need more

simple and 'structured-content' that contains lots of stuff 

we have created script 'streamline_jmdict_json.js' that unifies greatly
different types of jsons and just gives this format:

{
    "expression": "トランスジェニック生物",
    "reading": "トランスジェニックせいぶつ",
    "type": "n",
    "meanings": [
      "transgenic organism"
    ]
  },

super easy to seed to db, we might have lost some data in the process (it is complex)
but for alpha/beta we should be fine



// ----------------------------------- common text-parser backend ------------------------------------ //

we need to put all text parsing functionality to one backend container on some port 
mecab, kuroshiro, jitendex, jmdict, kanjidic, radkfile, ...

user specific stuff will be in the hardened python backend


// ----------------------------- Radicals + KRADFILE ------------------------------------ //

radical meanings taken from wikipedia:

// ------------------ how to fix issues with lemma/dictionary forms by mecab ----------------------- //

mecab kinda sucks in providing correct dictionary forms for many verbs 
we should use something else eventually 


nice overview of all tokenization options

fugashi whitepaper, also useful
