## 3. Comparative Analysis
### 못 [mot] vs. 안 [an]
While both **못** and **안** are used to negate verbs, they serve different purposes:
- **못** indicates **inability** or **impossibility**.
- **안** denotes **simple negation** or **refusal**.
**Examples:**
1. **못 먹어요.**  
   *I can't eat (due to illness, lack of time, etc.).*
2. **안 먹어요.**  
   *I don't eat (by choice, not hungry, etc.).*
### 못 [mot] vs. -지 못하다 [-ji motada]
- **못** is an adverb placed before the verb.
- **-지 못하다** is a verb ending attached after the verb stem.
Both express inability but **-지 못하다** is slightly more formal and emphatic.
**Examples:**
1. **못 가요.**  
   *I can't go.*
2. **가지 못해요.**  
   *I cannot go.*
