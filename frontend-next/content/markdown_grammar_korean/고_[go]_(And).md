## 3. Comparative Analysis
While **-고** is used to connect clauses, it's important to distinguish it from other conjunctions:
- **그리고**: A conjunction used at the beginning of a sentence to mean "and". It connects two sentences rather than clauses.
  - Example:   
    - 저는 사과를 먹었어요. **그리고** 바나나를 먹었어요.  
      *I ate an apple. **And** I ate a banana.*
- **-면서**: Used to indicate two actions occurring simultaneously.
  - Example:  
    - 그는 노래를 **부르면서** 춤을 춰요.  
      *He sings **while** dancing.*
