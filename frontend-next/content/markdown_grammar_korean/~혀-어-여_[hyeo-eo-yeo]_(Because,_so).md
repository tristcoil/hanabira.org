# Korean Grammar Point: ~혀/어/여 [hyeo/eo/yeo] (Because, so)

## 1. Introduction
In Korean, connecting clauses to express reasons or causes is essential for fluent communication. One common way to indicate cause and effect is by using the verb endings **~여/어/아** (*-yeo/-eo/-a*), which translate to "because" or "so" in English. This grammar point allows speakers to link two actions or states, where the first is the reason for the second.

## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
## Meaning and Usage
The endings **~여/어/아** are attached to the verb stem to indicate that the preceding clause is the reason for the following clause.
- **Usage**: To express causation or reason between two clauses.
- **Translation**: "Because...", "So...", "Therefore..."
## Structure and Formation
### Formation Rules
Attach the appropriate ending to the verb stem based on the final vowel of the stem:
1. **Verb stems ending with '아' or '오' vowel**: Add **-아** (-a)
2. **Verb stems ending with other vowels**: Add **-어** (-eo)
3. **Verb stems ending with '하다'**: Add **-여** (-yeo), often contracted to **-해** (-hae)
### Formation Diagram
| Verb Stem Ending          | Ending to Add | Resulting Form        | Example Verb | Conjugated Form |
|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Ends with vowel **아**/**오** | **-아**        | stem + **-아**         | 가다 (to go)  | 가**아**         |
| Ends with other vowels    | **-어**       | stem + **-어**        | 먹다 (to eat) | 먹**어**         |
| 하다 verbs                | **-여**       | 하 + **-여** = **해** | 공부하다 (to study) | 공부**해** |
### Examples of Conjugation
1. **가다** (to go): 가 + **-아** → **가아**

## 3. Comparative Analysis
## Comparison with **~아서/어서**

|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **~여/어/아**    | Cause and effect linkage       | Less common, formal/literary |

## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
## Error Analysis
1. **Misapplication of vowel harmony:**
   - Incorrect: *먹다* (to eat) → 먹**아**
   - Correct: *먹다* → 먹**어**
   **Tip**: Since *먹다* doesn't end with '아' or '오,' use **-어**.
2. **Overlooking contractions in 하다 verbs:**
   - Incorrect: 공부하다 → 공부하**여**
   - Correct (contracted form): 공부하**여** → 공부**해**
   **Tip**: Remember that **-하여** often contracts to **-해** for smoother pronunciation.
## Learning Strategies

- **Practice with Common Verbs**: Regularly conjugate verbs you use daily to internalize patterns.
- **Create Sentences**: Form your own sentences using **~여/어/아** to express reasons.
