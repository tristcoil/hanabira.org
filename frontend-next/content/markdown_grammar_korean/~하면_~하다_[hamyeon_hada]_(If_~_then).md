# Korean Grammar Point: ~하면 ~하다 [hamyeon hada] (If ~ then)

## Introduction
Conditional statements are essential in any language, allowing us to express possibilities, hypotheses, and logical sequences. In Korean, one common way to form conditional sentences is by using the structure **~하면 ~하다** (*If ~ then ~*). This construction enables speakers to articulate conditions and their results smoothly and naturally.

## 1. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
The structure **~하면 ~하다** translates to **"If [action/event], then [result/consequence]"** in English. It is used to express that if the first clause occurs, then the second clause will follow.
### Structure
#### Formation Diagram
```
[Verb/Adjective Stem] + 하면 + [Result Clause]
```
- **Verb/Adjective Stem**: The base form of the verb or adjective without the ending 다.
- **하면**: The conditional marker **(하 + 면)** meaning "if."
- **Result Clause**: The outcome or consequence that follows the condition.
#### Detailed Explanation
1. **Verb/Adjective Stem**: Identify the stem by removing **다** from the dictionary form.
   - **가다** (to go) → **가**
   - **먹다** (to eat) → **먹**
   - **크다** (to be big) → **크**
2. **Adding 하면**: Attach **하면** directly to the stem.
   - **가 + 하면 = 가하면** (if [someone] goes)
   - **먹 + 하면 = 먹하면** (if [someone] eats)
   - **크 + 하면 = 크하면** (if [something] is big)
   However, grammatically, for most verbs/adjectives, **~하면** is used when the verb is **하다** (to do). For other verbs or adjectives, we use **~(으)면**.
**Note**: The structure **~하면 ~하다** is most naturally used with **하다** verbs or when using **하면** to mean "if [someone] does [action]."

### Corrected Structure for General Verbs
For general verbs and adjectives, we should use **~(으)면** instead of **~하면**.
#### Proper Formation Diagram
```
[Verb/Adjective Stem] + (으)면 + [Result Clause]
```
- **If the stem ends with a consonant**, add **으면**.
  - **먹다** → **먹으면**
- **If the stem ends with a vowel**, add **면**.
  - **가다** → **가면**

| Verb/Adjective (Dictionary Form) | Stem  | Ends with Consonant/Vowel | Conditional Form    | Meaning           |
|----------------------------------|-------|---------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|

## 2. Comparative Analysis
### Comparing **~하면** and **~(으)면**
- **~하면** is specifically used with the verb **하다** (to do).
  - **일을 하면** → *If [someone] works*
- **~(으)면** is the general conditional ending used with all verbs and adjectives.
  - **비가 오면** → *If it rains*
  - **날씨가 좋으면** → *If the weather is good*
### Nuances
- While **~하면** can technically be attached to any verb, it is stylistically and grammatically correct to use **~(으)면** with verbs other than **하다**.
- Using **~하면** with non-**하다** verbs may sound unnatural or may be understood differently.

## 4. Cultural Notes
### Politeness Levels
Korean language heavily relies on speech levels and honorifics. The conditional **~(으)면** remains the same, but the verb endings in the result clause change according to the level of formality.
- **Formal Polite**: -어요/아요 endings
   - **가면 말해 주세요.**
     - *If you go, please tell me.*
- **Informal Polite**: -어/아 endings
   - **늦으면 연락해 줘.**
     - *If you're late, let me know.*
- **Formal Honorific**: -(으)십니다 endings
   - **오시면 알려 주십시오.**
     - *If you come, please let me know.*
### Idiomatic Expressions
1. **늦으면 늦을수록 좋다**
   - *The later, the better.*
2. **알면 알수록 모른다**
   - *The more you know, the less you know.*

## 5. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Common Mistakes
1. **Using ~하면 with non-하다 verbs**
   - **Incorrect**: **먹하면 배불러요.**
   - **Correct**: **먹으면 배불러요.**
   - *If I eat, I'm full.*
2. **Forgetting to add 으 with consonant-ending stems**
   - **Incorrect**: **읽면 알려 주세요.**
   - **Correct**: **읽으면 알려 주세요.**
   - *If you read it, please let me know.*
### Tips
- **Remember the (으) rule**:
  - **Consonant-ending stems**: Add **으** before 면 (**먹으면**)
  - **Vowel-ending stems**: Directly add **면** (**가면**)
- **Practice with 하다 verbs**:
  - Since **하다** is used in many verbs (e.g., **공부하다**, **운동하다**), practicing with these can help reinforce when to use **~하면**.

1. **Fill in the blank**: If the verb stem ends with a consonant, you add ______ before 면.
2. **Translate**: "If you do exercise, you become healthy."
3. **Identify the error**: **비가 오하면 가지 않아요.**
#### Answers
1. **으** (You add **으면**)
2. **운동하면 건강해져요.**
3. **Correction**: **비가 오면 가지 않아요.**
