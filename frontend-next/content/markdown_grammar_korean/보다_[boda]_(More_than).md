## 1. Introduction
In Korean, expressing comparisons is essential for daily communication. The particle **보다** (*boda*), meaning **"than"**, is a fundamental grammar point used to compare two things. Mastering **보다** allows you to describe preferences, differences, and similarities effectively.

## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
## Meaning and Usage
**보다** is used to compare two nouns, indicating that one has a greater degree of a certain quality than the other. It functions similarly to "than" in English comparative sentences.

```
- **Noun A**: The subject being compared.
