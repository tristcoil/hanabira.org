## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Comparing **~(이)어서** with **~(이)라서**
Both **~(이)어서** and **~(이)라서** are used to express reasons with nouns, but they have slight differences:
- **~(이)어서** is more colloquial and commonly used in spoken Korean.
- **~(이)라서** is also used to mean "because (it) is...", often interchangeable but can sound slightly more formal.
#### Examples:
- **학생이어서** 돈이 없어요. *(Because I am a student, I have no money.)*

## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Common Mistakes
1. **Misusing the Ending According to Noun Endings**
   - Incorrect: 의자**이어서**
     - *"의자" ends with a vowel; should be "의자여서"*
   - Correct: 의자**여서**
2. **Confusing with Verb Connectives**
   - **~(아/어)서** is used with verbs/adjectives, not nouns.
     - Example: 먹어서 (Because I eat)
     - Do not attach **~(아/어)서** directly to nouns.
### Tips
- **Remember the Noun Endings**: Use **이어서** after consonants, **여서** after vowels.
- **Mnemonic Device**: Consonant + **이어서** (think of "이" as needing a consonant to hold onto).
