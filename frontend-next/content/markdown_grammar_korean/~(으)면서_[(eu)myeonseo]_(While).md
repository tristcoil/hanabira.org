## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
- **~(으)면서** is attached to a verb stem to indicate that two actions occur at the same time by the same subject.
- It translates to **"while doing"** or **"as (someone) does"** in English.
### Structure
The formation of **~(으)면서** depends on whether the verb stem ends with a vowel or a consonant.

| Vowel            | **-면서**     | 가다 (to go)  | 가면서         |
| Consonant        | **-으면서**   | 먹다 (to eat) | 먹으면서       |

- **~(으)며** is often used in written or formal contexts.
### ~다가
- **~다가** indicates that an action was interrupted to start another action.
