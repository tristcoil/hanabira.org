## 1. Introduction
In Korean, particles play a crucial role in conveying the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence. Two of the most fundamental particles are **이** (*i*) and **가** (*ga*), which are subject markers. Understanding how to use these markers correctly is essential for constructing grammatically accurate sentences and for comprehension in both spoken and written Korean.

## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning and Usage
The particles **이** (*i*) and **가** (*ga*) are subject markers placed after nouns to indicate that the noun is the subject of the sentence—the person or thing performing the action or being described.
### Structure
- **Noun ending with a consonant + 이**
- **Noun ending with a vowel + 가**
### Formation Diagram
| Noun Ending | Subject Marker | Example            |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Consonant   | 이 (*i*)       | 집**이** (the house) |
| Vowel       | 가 (*ga*)      | 학교**가** (the school) |
### Detailed Explanation
#### Choosing Between 이 and 가
- **이** (*i*): Used after nouns that end with a consonant.
  - **책** (book) + **이** → **책이**
- **가** (*ga*): Used after nouns that end with a vowel.
  - **나무** (tree) + **가** → **나무가**
#### Function in Sentences
The subject marker **이/가** emphasizes **who or what** is performing the action or is in a certain state.

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### 은/는 vs. 이/가
Both **은/는** and **이/가** are particles related to the subject, but they serve different purposes.
- **은/는**: Topic markers used to indicate the topic of the sentence, often for contrast or emphasis.
- **이/가**: Subject markers used to identify the subject without additional emphasis or contrast.
**Example:**
- 저는 학생이에요. (*I am a student.*) - Topic marker indicating that "I" is the topic.
- 제가 학생이에요. (*I am a student.*) - Subject marker emphasizing that "I" specifically am the student.

Using **이/가** does not inherently convey politeness or formality; instead, formality is expressed through verb endings and honorifics. However, choosing the proper particle is essential for clear communication.
### Idiomatic Expressions Using 이/가
1. **눈에 불이 나다.**
   - *[Literal] Fire comes to the eyes.*
   - *[Meaning] Someone is very angry.*
   - Here, **불이** uses the subject marker **이**.

## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Common Errors
1. **Confusing 이/가 with 은/는:**
   - Misusing topic and subject markers can change the sentence's meaning.
2. **Incorrect Attachment After Nouns:**
   - Adding **이** after a vowel-ending noun or **가** after a consonant-ending noun.
### Tips to Remember
- **Consonant + 이**, **Vowel + 가**: Think "**C**onsonant → **이**", "**V**owel → **가**".
- **Mnemonic Device:**
  - "**이** comes after a **C**onsonant" (both have 'C' sounds).
  - "**가** comes after a **V**owel" (both vowels 'a').
