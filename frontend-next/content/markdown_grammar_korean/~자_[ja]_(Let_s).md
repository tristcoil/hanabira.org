## 1. Introduction
In this lesson, we'll explore the Korean grammar point **~자 [ja]**, which is used to make suggestions or proposals, similar to "Let's" in English. Mastering this grammar point will help you actively initiate activities and plans in casual conversations.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
## Meaning
**~자** is a casual sentence ending attached to verb stems to suggest doing something together with someone. It conveys the meaning of "Let's [do something]".
## Structure
### Formation
To form the **~자** ending:
1. **Take the verb stem** (remove **-다** from the dictionary form).
2. **Add 자** to the verb stem.
```markdown
**[Verb Stem] + 자**
```
### Example Formation
| Verb (Dictionary Form) | Verb Stem | + 자 | Meaning         |
|-------------------------|-----------|------|-----------------|
| 가다 (to go)            | 가        | 가자 | Let's go        |
| 먹다 (to eat)           | 먹       | 먹자 | Let's eat       |
| 시작하다 (to start)     | 시작하    | 시작하자 | Let's start     |
| 공부하다 (to study)     | 공부하    | 공부하자 | Let's study     |
## 3. Comparative Analysis

- **~자** vs. **~(으)세요**: **~(으)세요** is a polite imperative form used to make requests or suggestions in a polite manner.
