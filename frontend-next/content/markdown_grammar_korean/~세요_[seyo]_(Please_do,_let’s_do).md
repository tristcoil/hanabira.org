### Formation
#### Structure
To attach "~세요" to a verb:
1. **Identify the Verb Stem**: Remove "다" from the dictionary form of the verb.
2. **Attach "~(으)세요"**:
   - **If the verb stem ends with a vowel or the consonant "ㄹ"**, attach **"세요"**.
   - **If the verb stem ends with any other consonant**, attach **"으세요"**.
#### Formation Table

| Verb (Dictionary Form) | Verb Stem | Ending Letter | Add | Result       | Meaning                |
|------------------------|-----------|---------------|-----|--------------|------------------------|
| 가다 (to go)           | 가         | Vowel         | 세요 | 가세요       | Please go              |
| 오다 (to come)         | 오         | Vowel         | 세요 | 오세요       | Please come            |

| 만들다 (to make)       | 만들        | ㄹ (special case) | 세요 | 만드세요* | Please make            |

*Note: When a verb stem ends with "ㄹ", the "ㄹ" is dropped before adding "세요".
