### Formation Diagram

| Verb Stem |   +   | 고 보면 |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| 가         | +     | 고 보면 |
| 먹         | +     | 고 보면 |
| 생각하     | +     | 고 보면 |

### Detailed Explanation
- **Verb Stem**: The base form of the verb without **다**.
- **고**: A connective particle meaning "and" or used to link actions.
- **보면**: From **보다** (to see) + **-면** (if/when), meaning "if/when you see".
