### Meaning

- **"As (I) keep doing...",**
- **"While (I am) doing...",**
- **"Because (I) have been doing...",**

### Structure and Formation
#### Formation Diagram
| Verb Stem Ending | + Connector | Resulting Form |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Ends with a vowel or 'ㄹ' | 다 보니 | **Verb stem + 다 보니** |
| Ends with a consonant (excluding 'ㄹ') | **으** + 다 보니 | **Verb stem + 으다 보니** |
#### How to Form ~(으)다 보니
1. **Identify the verb stem** by removing **-다** from the dictionary form of the verb.
2. **Determine if the verb stem ends with a vowel or consonant**:
   - If it ends with a **vowel** or the consonant **'ㄹ'**, directly add **다 보니**.
   - If it ends with a **consonant** (other than 'ㄹ'), add **으다 보니**.
#### Examples:
- **가다** (to go):
  - 가 **+ 다 보니** = **가다 보니**
- **먹다** (to eat):
  - 먹 **+ 으다 보니** = **먹다 보니**
- **알다** (to know):
  - 알 **+ 다 보니** = **알다 보니**
*Note: Even though **먹다** ends with a consonant, when spoken, Koreans often simplify it to **먹다 보니** without adding **으**. Hence, both forms are acceptable in conversation.*
