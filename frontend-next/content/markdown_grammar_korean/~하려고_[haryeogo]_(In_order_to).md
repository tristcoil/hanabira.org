## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
"~하려고" is used to express **the purpose or intention** behind an action. It connects two clauses, indicating that the action in the first clause is done **in order to** achieve the action in the second clause.
### Structure
To form "~하려고," attach "~(으)려고" to the **verb stem** of the action you intend to do.
#### Formation Rules
| **Verb Stem Ending**     | **Attach** | **Example Verb** | **Conjugated Form** |

| Ends with a **vowel** or the consonant **ㄹ** | `려고`     | 가다 (to go)      | 가려고             |
| Ends with a **consonant** (other than **ㄹ**)     | `으려고`    | 먹다 (to eat)     | 먹으려고            |
#### How to Form
1. **Identify the verb stem**: Remove "다" from the dictionary form of the verb.
2. **Determine the ending**:
   - If the verb stem ends with a vowel or **ㄹ**, add **려고**.
   - If it ends with a consonant (other than **ㄹ**), add **으려고**.
