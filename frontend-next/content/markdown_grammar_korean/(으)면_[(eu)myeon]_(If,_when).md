# Korean Grammar Point: (으)면 [(eu)myeon] (If, when)

## 1. Introduction
In Korean, the conditional and temporal clause marker **(으)면** is widely used to express "if" or "when". It's an essential grammar point that allows speakers to discuss possibilities, conditions, and future events contingent on certain circumstances.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
The suffix **(으)면** is attached to verbs, adjectives, or nouns with the copular verb **이다** to form conditional statements. It conveys the meaning of "if" or "when", indicating that one action or state is contingent upon another.
### Structure
The formation of **(으)면** depends on whether the stem ends with a vowel or a consonant.
- **For stems ending with a consonant (excluding 'ㄹ'):**
  ```markdown
  [Verb/Adjective stem] + **-으면**
  ```
- **For stems ending with a vowel or the consonant 'ㄹ':**
  ```markdown
  [Verb/Adjective stem] + **-면**
  ```

3. **Attach the appropriate suffix:**
   - **먹** + **으면** = **먹으면** (If [I] eat)
