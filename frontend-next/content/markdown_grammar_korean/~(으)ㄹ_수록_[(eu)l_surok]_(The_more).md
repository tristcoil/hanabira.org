## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
The grammar structure **~(으)ㄹ수록** is used to indicate that as one action or state progresses or intensifies, another action or state also changes correspondingly. It's similar to saying "the more [A], the more [B]" in English.
### Formation
To form sentences using **~(으)ㄹ수록**, attach it to the verb or adjective stem according to the following rules:
1. **For verb/adjective stems ending with a consonant (except 'ㄹ')**:
   - Add **~을수록**
2. **For verb/adjective stems ending with a vowel or 'ㄹ'**:
   - Add **~ㄹ수록**
#### Formation Diagram
| Stem Ending                   | Addition      | Example Verb/Adjective | Result      |
|-------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Consonant (except 'ㄹ')       | ~을수록        | 먹다 (to eat)          | 먹을수록    |
| Vowel or 'ㄹ'                 | ~ㄹ수록        | 갈다 (to grind)        | 갈수록      |
|                               |               | 크다 (to be big)       | 클수록      |
### Structure of the Sentence
The typical sentence structure is:
```
[Verb/Adjective Stem + ~(으)ㄹ수록], [Resulting Action/State].
```
Sometimes, the second clause also uses **~(으)ㄹ수록** for emphasis:
```
[Verb/Adjective Stem + ~(으)ㄹ수록], [Verb/Adjective Stem + ~(으)ㄹ수록].
```

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with ~면 ~(으)ㄹ수록
- **~면 ~(으)ㄹ수록** combines **~면** ("if") with **~(으)ㄹ수록** to express "the more... if..."
- While **~(으)ㄹ수록** alone emphasizes the correlation between two increasing actions or states, adding **~면** can sometimes make the sentence sound redundant or overly conditional.
### Similar Grammar Point: **~자** ("as soon as")
- **~자** is used to indicate immediate succession ("as soon as") but does not convey the progressive intensification that **~(으)ㄹ수록** does.
