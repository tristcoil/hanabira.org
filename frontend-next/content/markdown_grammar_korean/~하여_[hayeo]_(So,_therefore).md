# Korean Grammar Point: ~하여 [hayeo] (So, therefore)


## 1. Introduction
The connective ending **~하여** (*hayeo*) is a formal Korean grammar point used to express a cause-and-effect relationship or to indicate a sequence of actions. It is the formal written form of **~해서** (*haeseo*) and is often found in literature, official documents, and formal speeches. Understanding **~하여** will enhance your ability to comprehend formal texts and communicate effectively in formal contexts.

## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
**~하여** is used to:
- Connect two clauses where the first clause is the cause or reason, and the second is the result or effect.
- Indicate that one action occurs after another in a sequence.
It translates to "so", "therefore", "and then", or "by doing" in English.
### Structure
#### Formation with **-하다** Verbs
Most commonly used with verbs ending in **-하다** (*-hada*).
```
[Verb Stem] + 하 + 여 → 하여
```
**Example:**
- **공부하다** (to study)
  - 공부하 + 여 → 공부하여
#### Formation with Other Verbs
While less common, **~여** can be attached to verb stems ending with vowels other than **ㅏ** or **ㅗ**.
```
[Verb Stem] + 여
```
**Examples:**
- **기다리다** (to wait)
  - 기다리 + 여 → 기다려
- **보이다** (to be seen)
  - 보이 + 여 → 보여
However, in modern Korean, these forms are often contracted (**기다려**, **보여**) and **~하여** remains primarily associated with **-하다** verbs in formal contexts.
