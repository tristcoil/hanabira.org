## 3. Comparative Analysis
### ~게 하다 vs. ~케 하다
- **~게 하다**: The standard causative form used after most verb or adjective stems.
- **~케 하다**: A variation of **~게 하다** used primarily after stems ending with the consonant **'ㅎ'** or for ease of pronunciation.
**Example:**
- **Standard Form**: 깨끗하게 하다 (to make clean)
- **Alternate Form**: 깨끗케 하다 (to make clean)
In this case, **깨끗하** (clean) ends with **'ㅎ'**, and combining it with **게 하다** results in **깨끗게 하다**, which is less natural. Therefore, it becomes **깨끗케 하다** for smoother pronunciation.
