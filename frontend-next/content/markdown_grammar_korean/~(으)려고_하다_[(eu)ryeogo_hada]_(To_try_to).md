#### Formation Chart
| Verb Stem Ending        | Suffix         | Example                      |
|-------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Vowel (ㅏ,ㅗ,ㅓ, etc.)     | -려고 하다      | 가다 → 가려고 하다           |
| Consonant (ㅂ,ㄱ,ㅈ, etc.) | -으려고 하다     | 먹다 → 먹으려고 하다         |
| Ending with ㄹ           | -려고 하다      | 살다 → 살려고 하다           |
### Formation Diagram
1. **Remove** **-다** from the dictionary form of the verb to get the verb stem.

     - **Verb Stem + -으려고 하다**
   - **Verb Stem ends with ㄹ**:
     - **Verb Stem + -려고 하다**
3. **Examples**:
   - **가다** (to go):
     - **가** + **려고 하다** → **가려고 하다** (intend to go)
   - **먹다** (to eat):
     - **먹** + **으려고 하다** → **먹으려고 하다** (intend to eat)
