## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
- **~(아/어/여)서** is used to connect two clauses, where the first clause is the reason or cause for the second clause.
- It translates to "so," "because," or "therefore" in English.
### Structure
- **Verb/Adjective Stem + 아/어/여서 + Result Clause**
### Formation Diagram
| Verb/Adjective Stem Ending | Connective Ending | Example Verb | Conjugated Form |
|----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Ends with **ㅏ** or **ㅗ**   | ~아서              | 가다 (to go)  | 가서            |
| Other vowels               | ~어서              | 먹다 (to eat) | 먹어서          |
| **하다** verbs             | ~여서 (**해서**)    | 공부하다 (to study) | 공부해서    |
### Formation Steps
1. **Identify the verb or adjective stem**:
   - Remove **다** from the dictionary form.
   - Example: **놀다** (to play) → **놀**
2. **Determine the correct connective ending**:
   - If the last vowel of the stem is **ㅏ** or **ㅗ**, use **~아서**.
   - If the last vowel is any other vowel, use **~어서**.
   - For **하다** verbs, use **~여서**, which often contracts to **~해서**.
3. **Attach the connective ending to the stem**:
   - Example: **놀** + **아서** → **놀아서**

## 5. Cultural Notes
### Politeness Levels
- **~(아/어/여)서** itself doesn't indicate politeness; it's neutral.
- The level of politeness is determined by the verb endings in the main clause.
  - **Formal Polite**: ~~습니다/습니다~~
    - Example: 늦어서 죄송합니다.
  - **Informal Polite**: ~~아요/어요~~
    - Example: 늦어서 미안해요.
  - **Casual**: ~~아/어~~
    - Example: 늦어서 미안해.
### Idiomatic Expressions
- **어서 오세요**: "Welcome"
  - While **어서** here looks similar, it's actually an adverb meaning "quickly" or "promptly," commonly used as a set phrase in Korean businesses to greet customers.
