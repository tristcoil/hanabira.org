## 5. Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
- **Floor Numbering in Korea**: Buildings in Korea typically count floors starting from the ground level as the 1st floor (**일층**). Unlike some Western countries where the ground floor is not counted as the 1st floor.
  
- **Tetraphobia**: The number **4 (사)** is sometimes considered unlucky in Korea due to its pronunciation similarity to the word for "death" (**사**). As a result, some buildings might label the 4th floor as **F** instead of **사층**.
### Idiomatic Expressions
While there aren't many idioms specifically using **~층**, understanding floor-related terminology is helpful:
- **고층 건물** (*gocheung geonmul*): High-rise building
- **저층** (*jocheung*): Low floor

## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips

  - Incorrect: *셋층* (**set-cheung**)
  - Correct: *삼층* (**sam-cheung**)
- **Confusing Counters**: Don't mix up **층** (floor) with **호** (room/apartment number).

### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic for Sino-Korean Numbers**: Practice counting from 1 to 10 in Sino-Korean to become comfortable.
  ```
  일, 이, 삼, 사, 오, 육, 칠, 팔, 구, 십
  ```
