## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
The grammar point **~전** translates to **"before"** in English. It's used to denote that one action or event happens prior to another.
### Structure

```
### Detailed Explanation
#### 1. Using **~전에** with Verbs
When combining **~전에** with verbs, you need to convert the verb into a noun form by adding **-기** to the verb stem.
**Formation Steps:**
1. **Take the Verb Stem**: Remove **-다** from the dictionary form of the verb.
   - Example: **하다** (to do) → **하** (Verb Stem)
2. **Add **-기****: Attach **-기** to the verb stem to nominalize it.
   - **하** + **기** = **하기**
3. **Add **전에****: Attach **전에** to indicate "before."
   - **하기** + **전에** = **하기 전에** ("before doing")
**Example:**
- **먹다** (to eat)
  - **먹** + **기** + **전에** = **먹기 전에** ("before eating")
#### 2. Using **~전에** with Nouns
When the word is already a noun, you simply add **전에** after it.
**Formation:**
- **Noun** + **전에**
**Example:**
- **수업** (class)
  - **수업** + **전에** = **수업 전에** ("before class")
