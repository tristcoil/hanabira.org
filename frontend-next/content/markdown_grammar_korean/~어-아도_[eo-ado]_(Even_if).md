## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
1. **Incorrect Vowel Selection**
   - *Mistake*: 가**어도** (from 가다)
   - *Correction*: 가**아도**
     - Since **가다** ends with the vowel **아**, it should be **가아도**, which contracts to **가도**.
2. **Neglecting Irregular Verbs**
   - *Mistake*: 듣**아도** (from 듣다)
   - *Correction*: 들**어도**
     - **ㄷ** irregular verbs like **듣다** change **ㄷ** to **ㄹ** before a vowel.
### Learning Strategies
- **Memorize the Vowel Harmony Rule**: If the last vowel of the stem is **아** or **오**, use **아도**; otherwise, use **어도**.
- **Practice with Common Verbs**: Create sentences using verbs you frequently use to get comfortable with the pattern.
- **Watch Korean Media**: Listen for the pattern **~어/아도** in dramas or songs to understand its usage in context.
