# Korean Grammar Point: ~이라도 [irado] (At least)

## Introduction
안녕하세요! 
In this lesson, we'll explore the Korean grammar point **~이라도 [irado]**, which translates to **"at least"** or **"even if it's just..."** in English. This expression is commonly used to suggest an alternative, often one that's not the first choice, but acceptable under the circumstances.
# Core Grammar Explanation
## Meaning and Usage
**~이라도** is used to:
- Offer or suggest an alternative option.
- Express a willingness to accept something that is not ideal.
- Indicate that something is better than nothing.
It conveys a sense of compromise or settling for a less preferred option when the ideal one is unavailable.
## Structure
### Formation
The attachment of **~이라도** depends on whether the noun ends with a consonant or a vowel:
- **Noun ending with a consonant + 이라도**
- **Noun ending with a vowel + 라도**
### Formation Diagram

| Noun Ending          | Attach   | Example Noun | Result       |
|----------------------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Consonant            | **이라도** | 빵 (bread)    | 빵**이라도**   |
| Vowel                | **라도**   | 물 (water)    | 물**이라도**   |

> **Note:** Although **물** ends with a consonant in spelling, it's considered to end with a vowel sound in this context. However, **물** actually ends with a consonant, so the accurate example for a vowel-ending noun should be something like **사과 (apple)** → **사과라도**.
Corrected Table:

| Noun Ending          | Attach   | Example Noun | Result          |
|----------------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Consonant            | **이라도** | 빵 (bread)    | 빵**이라도**      |
| Vowel                | **라도**   | 사과 (apple)   | 사과**라도**      |
