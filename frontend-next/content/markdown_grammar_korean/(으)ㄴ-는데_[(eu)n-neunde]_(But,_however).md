## 3. Comparative Analysis
While **(으)ㄴ/는데** often translates to "but" or "however," it's important to distinguish it from other conjunctions like **하지만**, **그러나**, and **그런데**.

  Example:
  ```
  비가 와요. 하지만/그러나 갈 거예요.
  (It's raining. But I'll go.)
  ```
- **(으)ㄴ/는데**: More versatile; links clauses within a sentence and can express contrast, background, or unexpected results.
