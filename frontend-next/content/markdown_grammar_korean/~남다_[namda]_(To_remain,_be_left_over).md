## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Mistake 1: Using the Wrong Particle
- **Incorrect**: 시간이 *을* 남았어요.
- **Correct**: 시간이 *이* 남았어요.
**Tip**: Use the subject particle **이/가** with **남다** because the subject is what remains.
### Mistake 2: Confusing 남다 and 남기다
- **Incorrect**: 음식을 많이 *남았어요*.
  (*Incorrect if you mean you deliberately left food uneaten.*)
- **Correct**: 음식을 많이 *남겼어요*.
**Tip**: Remember that **남다** means something remains on its own, while **남기다** implies an action of leaving something behind.
### Mistake 3: Incorrect Verb Conjugation
- **Incorrect**: 시간이 남아있어요.
  (*Technically not wrong, but redundant as 남다 already implies existence.*)
- **Correct**: 시간이 남아요.
**Tip**: **남다** already conveys existence; adding **있어요** is unnecessary.

- **Visual Mnemonic**: Imagine an object remaining on a table after others have been taken away. The object is **남다**—it remains by itself.
