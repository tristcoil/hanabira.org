### 2. Core Grammar Explanation
#### Meaning and Usage
- **~아/어도 (~해도)**: Used to express that **even if** or **even though** the action in the first clause occurs, the result in the second clause remains unaffected.
  - **Example**: 시간이 없어도 갈 거예요.
    - *Even if I don't have time, I will go.*
- **~아/어 봐도 (~해봐도)**: Adds the nuance of trying or attempting an action, meaning **even if one tries to**.
  - **Example**: 말해 봐도 소용없어요.
    - *Even if I try to say something, it's useless.*
#### Structure
##### Formation of **~해도 (~아/어도)**
1. **Identify the verb stem** by removing **~다** from the dictionary form.
2. **Determine the vowel** in the verb stem:
   - If the last vowel is **ㅏ** or **ㅗ**, add **~아도**.
   - For all other vowels, add **~어도**.
   - For verbs ending with **하다**, it becomes **해도**.
3. **Attach the ending** to the verb stem.
