# Korean Grammar Point: ~지 않을래 [ji anheullae] (I don't want to)

## Introduction
In this lesson, we will explore the Korean grammar point **~지 않을래** (*ji anheullae*), which translates to "**I don't want to**" or "**I'm not going to**" in English. This expression is used to convey the speaker's unwillingness or refusal to perform an action, often in a casual or informal context.

## Core Grammar Explanation
## Meaning and Usage
The grammar pattern **~지 않을래** is used to express:
- A polite refusal or unwillingness to do something.
- A subtle suggestion that the listener should not do something (when used in a question form).
It combines the negative form **~지 않다** ("do not") with the ending **~(으)ㄹ래** ("intention" or "want to"), resulting in a phrase that conveys "**I don't want to...**".
## Formation
### Structure
To form **~지 않을래**, follow these steps:
1. **Verb Stem**: Take the base form of the verb (remove **다** from the dictionary form).
2. **Add 지 않다**: Attach **지 않** to the verb stem to create the negative form.
3. **Attach 을래**: If the verb stem ends with a consonant, add **을래**; if it ends with a vowel, use **ㄹ래**.
### Formation Diagram
```
[Verb Stem] + 지 않 + 을래(요)
```
| Verb (Dictionary Form) | Verb Stem | Negative Form | Add 을래요 | Resulting Form      |
|------------------------|-----------|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| 가다 (to go)           | 가         | 가지 않       | 을래요     | 가지 않을래요       |
| 먹다 (to eat)          | 먹        | 먹지 않       | 을래요     | 먹지 않을래요       |
| 하다 (to do)           | 하         | 하지 않       | 을래요     | 하지 않을래요       |
### Notes
- **Politeness Level**: **~(으)ㄹ래요** is considered informal polite. It's appropriate for casual conversations but should be avoided in formal settings.
- **요** Ending: Adding **요** makes the expression polite. Dropping **요** makes it casual.
