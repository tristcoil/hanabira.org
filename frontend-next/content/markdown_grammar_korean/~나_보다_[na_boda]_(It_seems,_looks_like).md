## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning and Usage
**~나 보다** is used to express a guess or assumption based on indirect evidence or what you've observed. It's similar to saying:
- "It seems that..."
- "I guess..."
- "Looks like..."
### Structure and Formation
The formation of **~나 보다** depends on whether the verb is an **action verb** or a **descriptive verb (adjective)**.
#### For Action Verbs:
Attach **~나 보다** directly to the verb stem.
- **Formation**:
  ```
  [Action Verb Stem] + 나 보다
  ```
- **Examples**:
  | Verb (Dictionary Form) | Verb Stem | + 나 보다 | Meaning                    |
  |------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|
  | 가다 (to go)           | 가        | 가나 보다 | It seems (someone) goes    |
  | 먹다 (to eat)          | 먹        | 먹나 보다 | It looks like (someone) eats |
  | 오다 (to come)         | 오        | 오나 보다 | I guess (someone) is coming |
#### For Descriptive Verbs (Adjectives):
Use **~(으)ㄴ가 보다** instead.
- **Formation**:
  ```
  [Descriptive Verb Stem] + (으)ㄴ가 보다
  ```
- **Rules**:
  - If the stem ends with a consonant (except for 'ㄹ'), add **~은가 보다**.
  - If the stem ends with a vowel or 'ㄹ', add **~ㄴ가 보다**.
- **Examples**:
  | Verb (Dictionary Form) | Verb Stem | + (으)ㄴ가 보다 | Meaning                       |
  |------------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------|
  | 크다 (to be big)       | 크        | 큰가 보다      | It seems it's big             |
  | 작다 (to be small)     | 작        | 작은가 보다    | I guess it's small            |
