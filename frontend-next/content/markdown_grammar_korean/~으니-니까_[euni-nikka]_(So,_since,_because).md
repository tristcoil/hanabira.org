## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
Both **~으니** and **~니까** are used to indicate a reason or cause for the subsequent action or state. They can be translated as "because", "since", or "so".
### Structure and Formation
#### Formation Diagram
The basic structure for attaching **~으니** or **~니까** to verbs and adjectives is as follows:
| Verb/Adjective Stem Ending | Add       | Example Verb  | Conjugated Form |
|----------------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Ending with a consonant    | **으니까** or **으니** | 먹다 (to eat)  | 먹으니까 / 먹으니 |
| Ending with a vowel        | **니까** or **니**   | 가다 (to go)   | 가니까 / 가니   |
#### Detailed Steps
1. **Identify the verb or adjective stem**: Remove **다** from the dictionary form.
   - **먹다** → **먹**
   - **가다** → **가**
2. **Determine the ending**:
   - If the stem ends with a **consonant**, add **으니까** or **으니**.
   - If the stem ends with a **vowel**, add **니까** or **니**.
3. **Attach the appropriate ending**:
   - **먹** + **으니까** → **먹으니까**
   - **가** + **니까** → **가니까**
### Usage Notes
- **~으니까** is more commonly used in spoken Korean, whereas **~으니** is often found in written Korean or formal contexts.
