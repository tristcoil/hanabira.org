### Meaning and Usage
**~하여/해서** are verbal connectors used to:

### Structure and Formation

#### Detailed Explanation
1. **Verbs Ending with Vowels ㅏ or ㅗ:**

     - *가서 일이 있어요.* (I went, so there's something to do.)
2. **Verbs Ending with Other Vowels:**
   - Add **-어서** to the verb stem.
   Example:

     - *배고파서 먹었어요.* (I was hungry, so I ate.)
3. **Verbs Ending with -하다:**
   - Replace **-하다** with **-하여** or **-해서**.
   Examples:

     - *열심히 공부해서 합격했어요.* (I studied hard, so I passed.)
   - 운동하다 (to exercise) → 운동하여 / 운동해서
     - *매일 운동하여 건강해졌어요.* (I exercise every day, so I've become healthy.)
