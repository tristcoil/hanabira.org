     의사 + 지만 → 의사지만 (but [he is] a doctor)

## 5. Cultural Notes
### Politeness and Formality
- The use of **~지만** itself does not carry a level of politeness; politeness is conveyed through verb endings in the sentence.
- Adding **죄송하지만** or **미안하지만** at the beginning of a request adds politeness and softens the request.
  **Example:**
  - 죄송하지만 창문을 닫아 주시겠어요?
    - *I'm sorry, but could you close the window?*
### Idiomatic Expressions
- **아쉽지만**: "It's a shame, but..."
  - 아쉽지만 다음에 만나요.
    - *It's a shame, but let's meet next time.*

## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Common Mistakes
1. **Attaching Tense Markers Before ~지만**
   - Incorrect: 먹었지만다, 예뻤지만다
   - Correct: 먹었지만, 예뻤지만
   *Tense markers like **았/었** are placed before **~지만**, but do not add **다** after **~지만**.*
2. **Using **~지만** with a Conjugated Verb**
   - Incorrect: 갑니다지만, 공부해요지만
   - Correct: 가지만, 공부하지만
   *Attach **~지만** directly to the stem, not to the conjugated form.*
### Tips
- **Focus on the Verb/Adjective Stem:** Always attach **~지만** to the base form of the verb or adjective.
- **Remember the Noun Exception:** Use **이지만** after nouns ending with consonants, and **지만** after vowels.
- **Politeness Comes Later:** Adjust the level of politeness with the sentence-ending verb, not with **~지만**.
