### Formation Diagram

```
### Detailed Explanation

2. **(으)ㄹ**: Future tense modifier indicating the action is hypothetical or potential.
   - **When the verb stem ends with a consonant** (except **ㄹ**), add **을**.
     - **먹다** (to eat) → **먹** + **을** → **먹을**
   - **When the verb stem ends with a vowel** or **ㄹ**, add **ㄹ**.
     - **가다** (to go) → **가** + **ㄹ** → **갈**
     - **놀다** (to play) → **놀** + **ㄹ** → **놀ㄹ** (note: when stem ends with **ㄹ**, **ㄹ** is not doubled)
3. **리가 없다**: Means "there is no reason" or "it's impossible".
