# Korean Grammar Point: ~진 않지만 [jin anhjiman] (Not exactly, but)

## 1. Introduction
In this lesson, we'll explore the Korean grammar point **~진 않지만** *(jin anjiman)*, which translates to **"Not exactly..., but..."** in English. This expression is used to make a concession or partially disagree while introducing a contrasting statement. Understanding this grammar point will enhance your ability to express nuance and contrast in Korean conversations.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
## Detailed Explanation
### Meaning
The grammar point **~진 않지만** is used to acknowledge that something is **not entirely true** or **not exactly as stated**, but there's an exception or contrasting point to be made. It allows the speaker to softly disagree or present an alternative perspective without completely negating the previous statement.
### Structure
The structure of **~진 않지만** is formed by attaching it to the verb stem:
```
[Verb Stem] + 진 않지만
```
### Formation Diagram
Let's break down the components:
- **[Verb Stem]**: The base form of the verb without any endings.
- **~지**: A particle used to form negatives when combined with **않다**, turning the verb into its negative form.
- **않지만**: Combination of **않다** (to not do) + **지만** (but).
So, **~지 + 는 + 않지만** contracts to **~진 않지만**.
### Formation Example
For the verb **가다** *(gada, to go)*:
1. Verb Stem: **가**
2. Add **~지**: **가지**
3. Add **~는 않지만**: **가진 않지만**
However, in spoken Korean, **~지는 않지만** often contracts to **~진 않지만** for ease.
