## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Detailed Explanation
**~해야겠다** combines the verb **하다** (to do) with the auxiliary verb **~겠다**, which expresses the speaker's intention or decision about a future action. When attached to a verb stem along with **~아/어야**, it indicates that the speaker feels compelled to perform the action, often based on a sudden realization or new information.
#### Meaning
- **Should**, **must**, **have to**
- Indicates a **personal decision** or **realization** about the necessity to do something.
#### Structure
The general structure for forming **~해야겠다** is:
1. **Verb Stem** + **-아/어야** + **겠다**

```
- **Verb Stem**: Base form of the verb without 다
