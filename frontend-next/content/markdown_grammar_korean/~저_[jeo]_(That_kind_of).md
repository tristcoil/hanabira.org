## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Common Mistakes
#### Mistake 1: Confusing **저** with **그**
- **Error**: Using **저** when referring to something that is near the listener or has been previously mentioned.
- **Correction**: Use **그** in these cases.

**Correct**: **그 책이 네 거야?** *(Is that book [near you or previously mentioned] yours?)*

#### Mistake 2: Using **저** for Objects Near the Speaker
- **Error**: Using **저** instead of **이** for something near the speaker.
- **Correction**: Use **이** for objects near you.

**Incorrect**: **저 연필은 내가 사용할게.** *(I'll use that pencil over there.)*
**Correct**: **이 연필은 내가 사용할게.** *(I'll use this pencil.)*

### Learning Strategies
#### Mnemonic Device
- **이**: *"It's close to me."* (Both start with "I")
- **그**: *"Close to you."* ("You" and **그** both have a 'u' sound)
- **저**: *"Over there."* (Think "J" for "journey" away from both)
#### Practice Tip
