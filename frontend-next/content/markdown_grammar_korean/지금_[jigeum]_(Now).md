## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips

   - **Incorrect**: 저는 지금 먹고 있어요.
     - *jeoneun jigeum meokgo isseoyo.*
     - "I am eating now."
   - **Correct but Simplified**: 저는 먹고 있어요.
     - *jeoneun meokgo isseoyo.*
     - "I am eating."
2. **Confusing 지금 with 이제**:
   - **이제** signifies a change or "from now on," not just the current moment.
### Learning Strategies
- **Tip**: Associate **지금** with "immediate action." If something is happening right as you speak, **지금** is appropriate.
- **Mnemonic**: Remember **지** in **지금** as "G" for "Go" — things are happening "Go-time" now.
