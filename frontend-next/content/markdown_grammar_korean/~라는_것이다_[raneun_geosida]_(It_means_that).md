It functions similarly to the English phrases **"It means that..."** or **"What (someone) is saying is that..."**. Understanding this expression is essential for comprehending explanations and definitions in Korean conversations and texts.
## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
## Meaning
**~라는 것이다** is used to:
- **Clarify or restate** what has been said.
- **Define** or explain a term or concept.
- Emphasize the **essence or main point** of the preceding statement.
It combines the **indirect quotation marker ~라는** with **것이다** (which literally translates to "is a thing").
## Structure

```
[Clause] + ~라는 것이다
```
- **[Clause]**: A statement or phrase that you want to explain or define.
- **~라는 것이다**: Suffix used to indicate "it means that..."
### Formation Diagram
| Component             | Function                                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **[Base Form]**       | The dictionary form of the verb/adjective |
| **~라고 하다**         | Indirect quotation (say that...)         |
| **~는**               | Attributive modifier for verbs          |
| **것이다**            | "It is a thing" (used to explain)       |
Simplified, it becomes:
1. **Verb/Adjective Base Form** + **~라고** + **하는 것** + **이다**
2. Contracted to: **~라는 것이다**
## Example of Formation
Suppose we have the verb **말하다** (to speak/say):
1. **말하다** → **말라고 하는 것이다** → **말라는 것이다**
But typically, we attach **~라는 것이다** directly to the clause we want to explain.
