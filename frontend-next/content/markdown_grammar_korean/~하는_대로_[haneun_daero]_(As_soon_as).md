## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
The expression **~하는 대로** is used to indicate that one action happens immediately after another action is completed. It conveys the meaning of **"as soon as"** or **"right after"**. It's a way to link two events where the second event depends on the completion of the first.
### Structure
To form this expression, attach **~는 대로** to the verb stem of the first action.
#### Formation Diagram
```
[Verb Stem] + 는 대로 + [Second Action]
```
### Detailed Formation
1. **Identify the verb of the first action** (the action that must be completed first).
2. **Remove the 다 from the verb infinitive** to get the verb stem.
3. **Add ~는 대로** to the verb stem.
4. **Follow with the second action**, which occurs immediately after the first.
#### Example:
- **가다** (to go) → **가** (verb stem) + **는 대로** → **가는 대로**

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with ~자마자 [jamaja]
Both **~는 대로** and **~자마자** mean **"as soon as"**, but there are subtle differences:
- **~는 대로** can imply that the second action will be done **in the same manner** or **exactly as** the first action, depending on context.
- **~자마자** strictly means **"immediately after"** an action occurs, without the implication of manner.
#### Example:
- **집에 도착하는 대로 전화해 주세요.**
  - *Call me as soon as you arrive home* (implies immediacy and possibly following instructions).
- **집에 도착하자마자 전화해 주세요.**
  - *Call me immediately after you arrive home* (focuses purely on timing).
