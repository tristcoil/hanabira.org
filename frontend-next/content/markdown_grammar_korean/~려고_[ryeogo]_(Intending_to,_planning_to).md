### Structure
The structure of **~(으)려고** depends on whether the verb stem ends with a vowel or a consonant:

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### ~(으)려고 vs. ~(으)러
Both patterns are used to express purpose, but they have different usages:

| Aspect                   | **~(으)려고**                           | **~(으)러**                               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Meaning                  | Intend to, plan to                    | In order to (purpose of going/coming)    |
| Usage                    | With any action verbs                 | Only with movement verbs (가다, 오다, 다니다) |
| Example                  | 책을 읽으려고 해요. <br> (I intend to read a book.) | 책을 읽으러 도서관에 가요. <br> (I go to the library to read a book.) |

### ~(으)려고 하다 vs. ~(으)려고
- **~(으)려고 하다** adds a nuance of planning or considering, sometimes indicating uncertainty.
- **~(으)려고** alone is a direct expression of intention.

| Pattern                  | Example                                | Meaning                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| ~(으)려고                 | 한국에 가려고 비자를 신청했어요. <br> (I applied for a visa intending to go to Korea.) | Firm intention                          |
| ~(으)려고 하다            | 한국에 가려고 해요. <br> (I am planning to go to Korea.)         | Plan or consideration                   |
