## Common Mistakes and Tips
## Common Mistakes
1. **Using a positive verb after ~밖에**

     **저는 물밖에 마셔요.**
   - **Corrected:**  
     **저는 물밖에 안 마셔요.**  
     _I drink nothing but water._
2. **Confusing ~밖에 with ~만**
   - **Using ~만 when emphasizing insufficiency**
     - **Incorrect:**  
       **돈이 조금만 있어요.**
     - **Better:**  
       **돈이 조금밖에 없어요.**  
       _I have very little money (implying it's not enough)._
## Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device:**  
  Think of **밖** meaning "outside." So, **밖에** implies "outside of this, there's nothing." It emphasizes that only what's "inside" is present.
- **Remember the Negative Verb Rule:**  
  Always pair **~밖에** with a negative verb form to convey the correct meaning.
