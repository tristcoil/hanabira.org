# Korean Grammar Point: ~아/어서 [a/eoseo] (Because, so)

## 1. Introduction
The grammatical structure **~아/어서** is a fundamental connective ending in Korean that expresses **cause and effect** or reasons between two clauses. It is equivalent to the English conjunctions **"because"** or **"so"** and is essential for constructing coherent and logical sentences in Korean.

## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning and Usage
**~아/어서** is used to:
- Indicate that the action or state in the first clause is the **reason or cause** for the action or state in the second clause.
- Connect two actions that occur in a **sequence**, where the first action leads to the second.
### Structure
To correctly use **~아/어서**, follow these steps:
1. **Identify the Verb/Adjective Stem**:
   - Remove **다** from the dictionary form.
   - Example: 가다 (to go) → 가
2. **Determine the Appropriate Ending**:
   - **-아서** if the last vowel of the stem is **ㅏ** or **ㅗ**.
   - **-어서** if the last vowel is anything else (**ㅓ**, **ㅜ**, **ㅡ**, **ㅣ**).
   - **-해서** specifically for verbs ending with **하다**.
3. **Attach the Ending to the Stem**:
   - Combine the stem with the appropriate ending.
   - Example: 가 + 아서 = 가아서 → **가서**
#### Visual Aid: Formation Table
| Stem Ending Vowel | Ending   | Example Verb | Stem  | Result   |
|-------------------|----------|--------------|-------|----------|
| ㅏ or ㅗ          | -아서    | 만나**다**    | 만나  | 만나서   |
| Other vowels      | -어서    | 먹**다**      | 먹    | 먹어서   |
| **하**다         | -해서    | 공부**하다**  | 공부하 | 공부해서 |
### Important Notes
- **Tense and Politeness**:
  - The **tense** is only expressed in the **final verb** of the sentence.
  - **~아/어서** cannot be used with **imperative** or **propositive** sentences (commands or suggestions).
- **Subjects**:
  - The subject is often omitted if understood from context.
  - The subject can change between clauses if the context is clear.
