- Politeness is adjusted with verb endings and honorifics.
- In very formal situations, **そのような** may be used instead of **そんな**.
### Idiomatic Expressions

  *Sonna koto nai desu.*
  "That's not the case." / "That's not true."

- **そんな馬鹿な！**

## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips

  Be mindful of the context and physical or metaphorical distance:
  - **こんな**: Near the speaker
  - **そんな**: Near the listener or in context
  - **あんな**: Away from both or something not present
- **Overusing in Formal Writing:**
  In formal documents, prefer **そのような** over **そんな** for increased politeness.
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device:**
  Think of **"so"** in **"sonna"** to remember it relates to **"that"** (as in "so" referring to something previously mentioned).
- **Practice Creating Sentences:**
  Write your own sentences using **そんな** to describe things you've recently talked about or things someone else mentioned.
