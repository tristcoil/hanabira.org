### Error Analysis
1. **Omitting the Particle 'か'**
   - **Incorrect:** **なに食べたい。**
     - *Nani tabetai.*
     - "What do you want to eat?"
   - **Correct:** **なにか食べたい。**
     - *Nanika tabetai.*
     - "I want to eat something."
   *Explanation:* Without 'か', **なに** means "what," turning the sentence into a question.
2. **Confusing Formality Levels**
   - Using **なんか** instead of **なにか** in formal contexts.
     - **なんか** is colloquial and less formal.
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device:**
  - Remember that **か** at the end of **なに** turns "what" into "something" (an unspecified "what").
- **Practice Tip:**
  - Create sentences swapping **なにか** with **だれか** (someone) and **どこか** (somewhere) to get comfortable with indefinite pronouns.
