  - "I hope for much happiness."

### Error Analysis
- **Using the Wrong Verb Form**
  - Incorrect: *忘れないために、メモしてください。*
    - While grammatically correct, **ために** implies intentional control, which may sound unnatural here.
  
- **Confusing ように with ような**
  - **ような** is used to say "like/as," modifying nouns.
    - Example: *彼は猫のような目をしています。* ("He has eyes like a cat.")
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device**: Think of **ように** as "in the direction of the way things are," helping you remember it's used to express hopes or purposes toward a certain state.
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: Create your own sentences using **ように** to become comfortable with the different contexts it can be used in.
