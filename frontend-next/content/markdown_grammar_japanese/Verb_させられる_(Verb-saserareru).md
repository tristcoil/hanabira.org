## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
The **causative-passive form** indicates that the subject is **forced or made to perform an action** by someone else. It combines the **causative** (making someone do something) and the **passive** (being acted upon) forms.
### Structure
To form the causative-passive, we take the verb stem and conjugate it accordingly. Here's how it's formed:
1. **Group 1 Verbs (Godan verbs):**
   - Change the **u-ending** to the **a-ending**, add **-せられる**.
   - However, in spoken Japanese, **-せられる** often contracts to **-される**.
2. **Group 2 Verbs (Ichidan verbs):**
   - Remove **-る** and add **-させられる**.
3. **Irregular Verbs:**
   - **する** becomes **させられる**.
   - **くる** becomes **こさせられる**.
