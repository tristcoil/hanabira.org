## 3. Comparative Analysis
### ～ばかりだ vs. ～一方だ (〜いっぽうだ)
Both ～ばかりだ and ～一方だ indicate a continuous progression. However:
- **～ばかりだ** is often used for negative trends.
- **～一方だ** can be used for both positive and negative trends but is more neutral.
**Example**:
- 物価が上がるばかりだ。 (Prices keep rising - negative nuance)
- 物価が上がる一方だ。 (Prices are continuing to rise - neutral)
### ～たばかりだ vs. ～たところだ
Both express that an action has just occurred, but:
- **～たばかりだ** implies that not much time has passed since the action.
- **～たところだ** focuses on the immediacy right after the action.
**Example**:
- 今帰ったばかりだ。 (He just went home - could be a short while ago)
