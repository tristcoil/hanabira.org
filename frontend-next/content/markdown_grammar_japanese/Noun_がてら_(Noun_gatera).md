### 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
#### Common Mistake 1: Using Verbs Instead of Nouns
- **Incorrect:**  
  **走るがてら、公園に行く。**  
  *(Using the verb 走る "to run")*
  
- **Correct:**  
  **ランニングがてら、公園に行く。**  
  *(Using the noun ランニング "running")*
**Tip:** Always use the **noun form** of the activity before **「がてら」**.
#### Common Mistake 2: Confusing with 「ながら」
- **「ながら」** is used with verbs and means **"while doing..."** but typically for simultaneous actions by the same subject.
- **Example:**  
  **音楽を聴きながら、勉強する。**  
  *I study while listening to music.*
