### Error Analysis
1. **Using Affirmative Potential Form Instead of Negative**
   - **Incorrect**: **どうにか問題を解決できるものか。**
     - *"Is there a way to solve the problem?"* (Sounds less like a hopeful desire and more like doubting the possibility.)

   - **Incorrect**: **問題を解決できないどうにかものか。**

### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device**: Think of **どうにか** (somehow) at the **beginning**, and **ないものか** (isn't there a way) at the **end**, wrapping around the verb phrase.
- **Practice Potential Negative Forms**: Ensure you're comfortable forming the potential negative form of verbs.
  - **Verb Potential Form (できる)** → Negative (できない)
- **Rhetorical Question Tone**: Remember that **ないものか** creates a rhetorical question, expressing hope rather than expecting an answer.
