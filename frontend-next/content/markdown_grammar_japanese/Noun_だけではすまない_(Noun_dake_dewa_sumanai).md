## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
- **Mistake:** Using **"すまない"** to mean only "I'm sorry."
  - **Explanation:** While "すまない" can be an apology in casual speech, in this grammar point, it relates to "済む" meaning "to finish" or "to suffice," not an expression of apology.
- **Mistake:** Confusing **"だけではすまない"** with **"だけだ"** (it's just...).
  - **Explanation:** **"だけではすまない"** implies insufficiency and necessity for further action, whereas **"だけだ"** simply states something is only the noun mentioned.
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device:**  
  Think of **"すまない"** as "won't be *sum*-med up with," indicating that more is needed.
- **Practice:**  
  Create sentences where an action leads to consequences that cannot be resolved by simple means.
