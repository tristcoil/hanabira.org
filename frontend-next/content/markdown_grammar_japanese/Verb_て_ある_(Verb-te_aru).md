In this lesson, we will explore the Japanese grammar point **Verb てある (Verb-te aru)**.

## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
**Verb てある** is used to indicate that:
- **An action has been completed intentionally by someone**, and
- **The result of that action remains in a certain state**.
It emphasizes the **resultant state** of an intentional action performed by someone, often implying that the action was done for a specific purpose.
### Structure
The basic structure is:
```plaintext
[Object] が / は + Transitive Verb (て-form) + ある
```
- **[Object] が / は**: The object upon which the action has been performed.
- **Transitive Verb (て-form)**: The action that has been completed intentionally.
- **ある**: Indicates the existence of the resultant state.

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Verb ている vs. Verb てある
While both **ている** and **てある** can describe states, they have different nuances.
- **Verb ている (Verb-te iru)**:
  - Describes a state resulting from an action, without emphasis on who performed it.
  - Can be used with both transitive and intransitive verbs.
  - **Example**:
    - **ドアが開いている。**
      - *The door is open.* (State)
- **Verb てある (Verb-te aru)**:
  - Emphasizes that someone intentionally performed an action and the result remains.
  - Used only with transitive verbs.
  - **Example**:
    - **ドアが開けてある。**
      - *The door has been opened (by someone).* (Intentional action and result)
### Key Differences
| Aspect                | ている                               | てある                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Verb Type             | Transitive & Intransitive            | **Transitive only**                    |
| Emphasis              | State or ongoing action              | Result of an intentional action        |
| Performer Emphasized  | Often unspecified                    | **Action done by someone**             |
