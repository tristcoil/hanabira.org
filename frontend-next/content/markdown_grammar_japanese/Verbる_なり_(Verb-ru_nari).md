## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Comparison with 〜や否や (やいなや)

- **Difference**: While both indicate immediate actions, **なり** often carries a stronger sense of immediacy and sometimes unexpectedness.
- **Usage Example**:
  - **なり**: 彼は帰るなり、寝てしまった。(*As soon as he got home, he fell asleep.*)
  - **や否や**: 彼は帰るや否や、寝てしまった。(*No sooner had he got home than he fell asleep.*)
### Comparison with 〜とたん(に)
- **〜とたん(に)** means "*just as*" or "*the moment*".
- **Difference**: **〜とたん(に)** is used for events that happen unexpectedly and is not used with volitional actions, whereas **なり** can be used with volitional actions.
- **Usage Example**:
  - **なり**: 彼はドアを開けるなり、中に入った。(*As soon as he opened the door, he went inside.*)
