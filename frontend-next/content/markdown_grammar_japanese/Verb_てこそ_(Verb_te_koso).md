## 3. Comparative Analysis
### Verb てこそ vs. Verb てはじめて
- **Verb てこそ** emphasizes that the action is a prerequisite for something significant to happen.
- **Verb てはじめて** means "only after doing ~" and often implies a realization or occurrence that happens afterward.

  *Only when you make an effort can you succeed.*
- **てはじめて:** 日本に来てはじめて、温泉に入りました。  
  *I first experienced hot springs after coming to Japan.*

  *Only by meeting him can you understand his good qualities.*

### Cultural Relevance
In Japanese culture, experiencing something firsthand is often valued over secondhand knowledge. The use of **てこそ** reflects this cultural emphasis on direct experience and the belief that understanding or significant outcomes come only through personal action or effort.
### Levels of Politeness
- **てこそ** itself is neutral and can be used in both formal and informal contexts.
- Politeness is adjusted with verb endings and surrounding language, not with **てこそ**.
### Idiomatic Expressions
- **働いてこそ食べられる。**  
  *Only by working can you eat.*  
  (Emphasizes the necessity of work to earn a living.)
