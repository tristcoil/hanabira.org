# Japanese Grammar Point: ～たきり (〜takiri)

## 1. Introduction

## 2. Core Grammar Explanation
### Meaning
- **Since ~**
- **After ~**
- Indicates that **since the action took place, nothing has changed, and the expected or intended action hasn't occurred**.
### Formation
To form this grammar point, attach **きり** to the **た-form** of a verb.
```markdown
**Verb (た-form) + きり**
```

## 3. Comparative Analysis
### 〜て以来 (〜te irai) vs. 〜たきり
Both **〜て以来** and **〜たきり** express that **since** a certain action occurred, something has continued. However:
- **〜て以来** is used in broader contexts and **emphasizes continuity** from the past to the present.
- **〜たきり** often implies that **the expected action hasn't occurred** since then.
| Grammar Point | Usage                                | Nuance                             |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 〜て以来       | Since doing ~ (and continuously)     | Emphasis on continuous state       |
| 〜たきり       | Since doing ~ (and no change)        | Emphasis on lack of expected action |

- **Formal:** Used in both formal and informal settings, but often found in written language to describe situations where something hasn't happened since a certain point.
- **Informal:** Common in spoken language to express surprise or frustration about the lack of change.
## 5. Cultural Notes
### Cultural Relevance
In Japanese culture, there is often an expectation of promptness and regular communication. Using **〜たきり** can imply a sense of disappointment or concern that someone hasn't been in touch or that something hasn't progressed as anticipated.
### Idiomatic Expressions
- **寝たきり**
  *Netakiri*
  _Bedridden; confined to bed_
  - This is an idiomatic use where **〜たきり** combines with **寝る (neru)** to describe someone who remains in bed due to illness or age.
## 6. Common Mistakes and Tips
### Error Analysis
1. **Using the dictionary form instead of the た-form**
   - Incorrect: **彼は出かけるきり戻ってこない。**
   - Correct: **彼は出かけたきり戻ってこない。**
2. **Confusing with 〜っきり meaning "only"**
   - **〜っきり** as in **二人っきり (just the two of us)** is different from **〜たきり**.
### Learning Strategies
- **Mnemonic Device:** Remember that **たきり** ties back to the **た-form**, indicating a past action, and **きり** signifies "just" or "only," emphasizing that only that action occurred, and nothing has followed.
- **Practice:** Create sentences using familiar verbs in the た-form + きり to reinforce the structure.
