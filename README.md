## Self-Hosting

Hanabira (https://hanabira.org/) can be easily run locally or on your server/laptop just with 3 commands. To get started quickly, you can run Hanabira public Docker images.
Images/containers are big (several GB each), unoptimized and run under root user. Use at your own risk.

1. **Quick Start**

Use clean VirtualBox Linux Ubuntu based VM machine.

Start pre-made public hanabira containers. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tristcoil/hanabira.org.git 
cd hanabira.org 
docker-compose up
```

Hanabira will be then accessible locally on:
http://localhost:8888/

If you cannot reach the website locally, we recommend to check if all containers are running and to clear browser cache.
Sometimes new release will have breaking change in database (during early development), in such case delete `user_data` directory in the same directory where `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

Optional: Check docker-compose.yml file for path to configs where you can insert your DEEPL, OpenAI and Google analytics API keys and tracking codes.

Build (and run) containers yourself locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tristcoil/hanabira.org.git 
cd hanabira.org 
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
These will miss audio files though, since audio is not part of the repo.





Note: Hanabira project has main upstream private repo, the public one contains only individual releases (not day-to-day dev progress).

### Kanjidic Project
We are using the kanji dictionary from the KANJIDIC Project.

We took the KANJIDIC2 file, which is in XML format, encoded in Unicode/UTF-8, and contains information about all 13,108 kanji. You can download the file [here](http://www.edrdg.org/kanjidic/).

After downloading, we extract the file to XML format. Then, we use our custom Python script to convert it to a JSON file for easier processing. The resulting JSON file is approximately 50 MB in size.

Unfortunately, we encountered issues downloading files from these older sites due to errors. However, we found a repository under the MIT License for JMDict (used for Yomitan) that is frequently updated. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/scriptin/jmdict-simplified).

We downloaded the JMDict file from that repository, which does not include example sentences from Tatoeba. In the future, we may download the larger file as well.
